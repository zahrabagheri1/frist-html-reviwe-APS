              Founded by Amancio Ortega in 1975, Zara is a flagship clothing
              chain store that is part of Inditex group, the world's largest
              apparel retailer. Amancio Ortega opened the first Zara store in
              1975 in central A Coruña, Galicia, Spain where the company is
              still based. Ortega initially named the store Zorba after the
              classic 1964 film Zorba the Greek, but after learning there was a
              bar with the same name two blocks away, the letters were remolded
              for the sign to say "Zara". It is believed the extra a came from
              an additional set of letters that had been made for the company.<a
                href="#not-6"
                ><sup>[6]</sup></a
              ><a href="#not-7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> The first store featured
              low-priced lookalike products of popular, higher-end clothing
              fashions. Ortega opened additional stores throughout Spain. During
              the 1980s, Ortega changed the design, manufacturing, and
              distribution process to reduce lead times and react to new trends
              in a quicker way, which he called "instant fashions". The
              improvements included the use of information technology and groups
              of designers instead of individuals.

            In 1985, Amancio Ortega set up a parent company for Zara before
            engaging in global expansion, and in 1988, the company started its
            international expansion through Porto, Portugal.<a href="#not-8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>
            In 1989, it entered the United States, and then France in 1990.<a href="#not-9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>
            During the 1990s, Zara expanded to Mexico (1992)
            <a href="#not-10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> and Greece, Belgium and
            Sweden (1993). In the early 2000s, Zara opened its first stores in
            Brazil (2000); Japan and Singapore (2002); Venezuela, Russia and
            Malaysia (2003);<a href="#not-11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>

              In September 2010, Zara launched its online boutique. The website
              began in Jordan.<a href="#not-26"><sup>[26]</sup></a>
                In November of that same year, Zara Online
              extended its service to five more countries: Austria, Ireland, the
              Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg.<a href="#not-27"><sup>[27]</sup></a>

            </p>
            <p>
              Zara introduced the use of RFID technology in its stores in 2014.
              The RFID chips are located in the security tags which are removed
              from clothing when purchased and can be reused. The chip allows
              the company to quickly take inventory by detecting radio signals
              from the RFID tags. When an item is sold, the stockroom is
              immediately #notified so that the item can be replaced. An item
              that is #not on the shelf can easily be found with the RFID
              tag.<a href="#not-37"><sup>[37]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2015, Zara was ranked #30 on Interbrand's list of best global
              brands.<a href="#not-38"><sup>[38]</sup></a>
            </p>

            <p>
              In 2019, Zara updated their logo. <a href="#not-39"><sup>[39]</sup></a>
            It was designed by the
              French agency Baron & Baron.<a href="#not-40"><sup>[40]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2019, the global fashion business Journal MDS stated that while
              the textile commerce of the world had gone down by 2.38%, Zara's
              had risen 2.17%.<a href="#not-41"><sup>[41]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2019, Chief Executive Persson said the brand is waiting for
              more acceptable global rent levels to continue its expansion. In
              Europe, the brand planned to cut the number of retail locations
              beginning in 2020.<a href="#not-42"><sup>[42]</sup></a>

            Zara stores have men's and women's clothing as well as children's
            clothing (Zara Kids). Zara Home designs are located in European
            stores. The majority of Zara customers are aged between 18 and about
            35. After products are designed, they take 10 to 15 days to reach
            the stores.<a href="#not-43"><sup>[43]</sup></a> All of the clothing
            is processed through the distribution center in Spain. New items are
            inspected, sorted, tagged, and loaded into trucks. In most cases,
            the clothing is delivered within 48 hours. Zara produces over 450
            million items per year.<a href="#not-44"><sup>[44]</sup></a>
          </p>
          <p>
            Zara also includes accessories, shoes, swimwear, beauty and

            <section>
                <p>Reportedly, Zara needs just one week to develop a new product and get it to stores, compared to the six-month industry average, and makes roughly 40,000 designs of which around 12,000 new designs are carefully selected and produced each year.[46] Zara has a policy of zero advertising;[6] the company preferred to invest a percentage of revenues in opening new stores instead.<a href="#not-47"><sup>[47]</sup></a></p>
    
                <p>Zara set up its own factory in La Coruña (a city known for its textile industry) in 1980 and upgraded to reverse milk-run-type production and distribution facilities in 1990. This approach, designed by Toyota Motor Corp., was called the just-in-time (JIT) system. It enabled the company to establish a business model that allows self-containment throughout the stages of materials, manufacture, product completion, and distribution to stores worldwide within just a few days.<a href="#not-48"><sup>[48]</sup></a></p>
    
                <p>Most of the products Zara sells are manufactured in Spain, Portugal, Turkey, Morocco, Bangladesh <a href="#not-6"><sup>[6]</sup></a><a href="#not-49"><sup>[49]</sup></a> and more recently - Armenia . While some competitors outsource all production to Asia, Zara manufactures its most fashionable items – half of all its merchandise – at a dozen company-owned factories in Spain (particularly in Galicia), Portugal (northern part) and Turkey. Clothes with a longer shelf life, such as basic T-shirts, are outsourced to low-cost suppliers, mainly in Asia.<a href="#not-50"><sup>[50]</sup></a></p>
    
                <p>The company can design a new product and have finished goods in its stores in four to five weeks; it can modify existing items in as little as two weeks. Shortening the product life cycle means greater success in meeting consumer preferences.<a href="#not-51"><sup>[51]</sup></a>If a design does #not sell well within a week, it is withdrawn from shops, further orders are canceled and a new design is pursued. Zara monitors customers' fashion changes.<a href="#not-52"><sup>[52]</sup></a> Zara has a range of basic designs that are carried over from year to year, but some fashion-forward designs can stay on the shelves less than four weeks, which encourages Zara fans to make repeat visits. An average high-street store in Spain expects customers to visit three times a year. That goes up to 17 times for Zara.<a href="#not-53"><sup>[53]</sup></a></p>
    
                <p>As a result of increasing competitive pressures from the online shopping market, Zara is shifting its focus onto online as well, and will consequently open fewer but larger stores in the future.<a href="#not-54"><sup>[54]</sup></a></p>

                <p>In 2007, Zara withdrew a handbag from its shelves after a customer noticed a swastika on the bag's design. The bag came from an external supplier, and Zara claimed the symbol was not visible when the handbag was chosen. Zara withdrew the product from stores, and spokesperson Susan Suett said the bag would not have been sourced had the symbol been apparent.<a href="#not-60"><sup>[60]</sup></a></p>

                <p>In August 2014, Zara received criticism for selling a toddler T-shirt for closely resembling uniforms worn by Jewish concentration camp inmates. The T-shirt was striped and featured a yellow star similar to the Star of David. Zara said the design was inspired by "the sheriff's stars from the classic western films". Zara removed the shirt from sale a few hours after they appeared for sale, and apologized.<a href="#not-61"><sup>[61]</sup></a> Zara received criticism for selling the T-shirt in Israel because the country does not have sheriffs. Additionally, the word "Sheriff" is outlined in transparent letters on the bright yellow star.<a href="#not-61"><sup>[61]</sup></a> The Anti-Defamation League responded to the shirt, saying that it was offensive, but welcomed Zara's recognition of the potential imagery and removing the shirt from sale.<a href="#not-62"><sup>[62]</sup></a></p>

                <p>In August 2011, a Brazilian television show accused the company of using sweatshops for their outsourced production. The Regional Superintendency of Labour and Employment of São Paulo, Brazil, closed a factory that produced Zara's clothing for its poor labour conditions.<a href="#not-63"><sup>[63]</sup></a> Zara's representatives said the accusations of slave labour made against the retailer represent a breach of the code of conduct for workshops of Inditex. The company also states factories responsible for unauthorized outsourcing have been asked to regularize immediately the situation of the workers involved.<a href="#not-64"><sup>[64]</sup></a></p>

                <p>In September 2013, Bangladeshi garment workers for suppliers to Zara and its parent company, Inditex, protested following the 2013 Dhaka garment factory collapse, demanding a US$100 a month minimum wage.<a href="#not-65"><sup>[65]</sup></a> Inditex does not publicly disclose the factories that produce their branded clothing.<a href="#not-66"><sup>[66]</sup></a></p>

                <p>In November 2017, customers shopping at Zara stores in Istanbul, Turkey, found handwritten notes purportedly from Turkish workers in the pockets of in-store garments asking shoppers to pressure Zara into paying them unpaid wages.<a href="#not-67"><sup>[67]</sup></a> The company clarified the unpaid wages were due to a third-party manufacturer Bravo Tekstil,<a href="#not-68"><sup>[68]</sup></a> who had failed to pay their employees. The company said they would help to provide compensation to employees who weren't paid.<a href="#not-69"><sup>[69]</sup></a> In the agreement, only factory-floor employees were compensated, with "white-collar" employees not covered by the agreement.<a href="#not-70"><sup>[70]</sup></a></p>

                <p>In July 2016, complaints were made against Zara that they had been stealing designs from multiple independent designers for their products. One of the designers, Tuesday Bassen, who previously worked with brands including Urban Outfitters and Nike, contacted Zara. The company responded Bassen's designs were not distinctive enough, and they received only a handful of complaints given the large volume of traffic they receive on their site. When the news was eventually picked up by media outlets, and Inditex, Zara's owning company, was asked to comment on the issue, Inditex replied that the items in question have been suspended from sale, and that they are in contact with Bassen's lawyer to clarify and address the issue.<a href="#not-71"><sup>[71]</sup></a><a href="#not-72"><sup>[72]</sup></a></p>
                <p>As of April 2018, MaXhosa by Laduma is taking legal action against Zara for copying its designs.<a href="#not-73"><sup>[73]</sup></a> Zara responded to complaints from the designer by removing socks that resembled his artistic style.<a href="#not-74"><sup>[74]</sup></a></p>

                <p>In September 2019, Zara supported Hong Kong strikes; however after pressures from Chinese social media Zara was forced to issue a statement expressing its support of the "one country, two systems" policy adopted by China in ruling Hong Kong, and its disapproval of anti-government strikes.<a href="#not-77"><sup>[77]</sup></a></p>
